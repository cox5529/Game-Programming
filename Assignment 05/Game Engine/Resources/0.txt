On October 8, 2015 around 11:00 PM, Jason Ly was writing a hangman program.
While writing his hangman program, Jason was hit with divine inspiration from
the god of hangman. Upon receiving his inspiration, Jason wrote "Hungman."
Because Jason felt that Hungman was the will of the gods,
Jason safeguarded Hungman with his life. While Jason being inspired,
he was taught by the gods to duplicate himself. He used his duplicates
to help him protect Hungman from the rest of the world. With his first set
of duplicates, he messed up and failed to give them the ability to move.
With his second set, he gave them the ability to move around a fixed path.
He never failed to give his duplicates the ability to throw
balls at people, however.
